We are happy to share what's the highlights on our release [v1.13.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb/1.13.0). This release note corresponds to the library's [release tag v1.13.0](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB/releases/tag/v1.13.0).

# Trace Feature Refactoring

In this release, we have refactored how the tracing has been implemented. The user story can be found [here](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB/issues/941). This is a breaking changes!

The interface [ITrace](https://repodb.net/interface/itrace) method has been simplified. There will only be 4 methods available moving forward.

| Method  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| BeforeExecution | Triggered before the actual database operation is being executed. |
| AfterExecution | Triggered after the actual database operation has been executed. |
| BeforeExecutionAsync | Triggered before the actual database asynchronous operation is being executed. |
| AfterExecutionAsync | Triggered after the actual database asynchronous operation has been executed. |

All [operations](https://repodb.net/operation) will be having an optional `traceKey` argument. By default, the value of the `traceKey` is the name of the operation itself. The list can be found in the [TraceKeys](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB/blob/master/RepoDb.Core/RepoDb/Trace/TraceKeys.cs) class.

Let us say have created the trace class below.

```csharp
public class ApplicationTracer : ITrace
{
    public void BeforeExecution(CancellableTraceLog log)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public void AfterExecution<TResult>(ResultTraceLog<TResult> log)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public Task BeforeExecutionAsync(CancellableTraceLog log,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public Task Task AfterExecutionAsync<TResult>(ResultTraceLog<TResult> log,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

See below the sample code when calling the [Insert](https://repodb.net/operation/insert) operation.

```csharp
var user = GetNewlyRegisteredUser();
var result = connection.Insert<User>(user, traceKey: TraceKeys.Insert, trace: new ApplicationTracer());
```

You can now allow to pass any value to the `traceKey` argument.

```csharp
var user = GetNewlyRegisteredAdminUser();
var result = connection.Insert<User>(user, traceKey: "InsertAdminUser", trace: new ApplicationTracer());
```

Then, capture the information of the operation and do something else within your trace class before the actual execution.

```csharp
public void BeforeExecution(CancellableTraceLog log)
{
    Logger.Log($"SessionId: {log.SessionId}, Statement: {log.Statement}, Parameters: {log.Parameter.AsJson()}")

    if (log.Key == TraceKey.Insert)
    {
        // Do something for 'Insert'
    }
    else if (log.Key == "InsertAdminUser")
    {
        // Do something for 'InsertAdminUser'
    }
    else
    {
        // Cancel and throw the exception
        log.Cancel(true);
    }
}
```

And also, do further actions upon completion.

```csharp
public void AfterExecution<TResult>(ResultTraceLog<TResult> log)
{
    Logger.Log($"SessionId: {log.SessionId}, ExecutionTime: {log.ExecutionTime.TotalMilliseconds}, Result: {log.Result.AsJson()}")

    if (log.Key == TraceKey.Insert)
    {
        // Do something for 'Insert'
    }
    else if (log.Key == "InsertAdminUser")
    {
        // Do something for 'InsertAdminUser'
    }
}
```

> Note: Both methods `BeforeExecution` and `AfterExecution` will be invoked when you call any operation of the library.
